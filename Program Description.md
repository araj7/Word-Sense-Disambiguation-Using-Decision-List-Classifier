# Word Sense Disambiguation Using Decision List Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a Decision List Classifier for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), focusing on the word "line" in different contexts. The classifier uses features inspired by Yarowskyâ€™s method to effectively learn from labeled training data and assign the correct sense to ambiguous words in test data.

## Key Features
- **Training with XML Data:** Learns a decision list from annotated examples in `line-train.xml`.
- **Context-Based Classification:** Classifies the sense of the word "line" in test sentences based on the learned decision list.
- **Output:** Generates a decision list log for debugging and outputs predicted sense tags for test sentences.
- **Performance Metrics:** Includes accuracy calculation and confusion matrix generation to evaluate classifier performance.

## How It Works
1. **Training:**
   - The program reads `line-train.xml`, which contains examples of the word "line" annotated with senses (e.g., "phone line" or "product line").
   - A decision list is generated based on contextual features.

2. **Testing:**
   - The decision list is applied to classify the sense of "line" in sentences from `line-test.xml`.
   - Predicted sense tags are compared with the gold standard answers in `line-answers.txt`.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Calculates accuracy by comparing predicted and actual senses.
   - Generates a confusion matrix to analyze classification performance.

## Usage
Run the program from the command line:

```bash
python decision-list.py line-train.xml line-test.xml my-decision-list.txt > my-line-answers.txt
```

- **Input Files:**
  - `line-train.xml`: Contains labeled examples for training.
  - `line-test.xml`: Contains test sentences to classify.
- **Output Files:**
  - `my-decision-list.txt`: Decision list log for debugging.
  - `my-line-answers.txt`: Predicted sense tags in the required format.

### Additional Evaluation Script
To evaluate the performance of the classifier:

```bash
python scorrer.py my-line-answers.txt line-answers.txt
```

This script calculates accuracy and generates a confusion matrix for detailed analysis.

## Data Description
- **line-train.xml:** Annotated training data with sense labels for the word "line."
- **line-test.xml:** Test data without sense labels.
- **line-answers.txt:** Gold standard sense tags for test sentences.

## Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `bs4`
- `re`

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4
```

## Repository Structure
- `decision-list.py`: Main script for training and testing the classifier.
- `scorrer.py`: Evaluation script for accuracy and confusion matrix.
- `line-data/`: Directory containing the XML data files.

## Technical Highlights
- **Contextual Features:** Incorporates contextual clues for disambiguation.
- **Decision List:** Implements a robust method for learning word senses based on training data.
- **Performance Analysis:** Includes scripts for accuracy measurement and confusion matrix generation.

## Example
To classify senses and evaluate the model:

1. Train and test the classifier:
   ```bash
   python decision-list.py line-train.xml line-test.xml my-decision-list.txt > my-line-answers.txt
   ```

2. Evaluate performance:
   ```bash
   python scorrer.py my-line-answers.txt line-answers.txt
   ```
